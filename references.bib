abstract = {Abstract Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper explores the effectiveness of parallel stylometric document embeddings in solving the authorship attribution task by testing a novel approach on literary texts in 7 different languages, totaling in 7051 unique 10,000-token chunks from 700 PoS and lemma annotated documents. We used these documents to produce four document embedding models using Stylo R package (word-based, lemma-based, PoS-trigrams-based, and PoS-mask-based) and one document embedding model using mBERT for each of the seven languages. We created further derivations of these embeddings in the form of average, product, minimum, maximum, and l2 norm of these document embedding matrices and tested them both including and excluding the mBERT-based document embeddings for each language. Finally, we trained several perceptrons on the portions of the dataset in order to procure adequate weights for a weighted combination approach. We tested standalone (two baselines) and composite embeddings for classification accuracy, precision, recall, weighted-average, and macro-averaged F1-score, compared them with one another and have found that for each language most of our composition methods outperform the baselines (with a couple of methods outperforming all baselines for all languages), with or without mBERT inputs, which are found to have no significant positive impact on the results of our methods.},
