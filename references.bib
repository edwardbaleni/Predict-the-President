abstract = {Summary. I discuss the production of low rank smoothers for d ≥ 1 dimensional data, which can be fitted by regression or penalized regression methods. The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with ‘knot placement’ that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

ABSTRACT = {In this contribution, a scattered data approximation problem, chosen from the literature and using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach, is considered for the application of point cloud modelling. Three solutions are investigated for the approximation problem. First, a technique known from the literature is investigated using a linear combination of thin-plate splines and linear polynomials, with additional constraint equations. Then, using the same approximation function as before, a technique is developed for a rigorous consideration of the constraint equations. Finally, a technique is presented in which the approximation function consists only of a linear combination of thin-plate splines, without the introduction of linear polynomials and constraint equations. In addition, some interpolation problems with the RBF approach are discussed to present the differences between an interpolation with thin-plate splines only and an interpolation with thin-plate splines together with linear polynomials and constraint equations. Numerical examples are given to illustrate and discuss the solutions from the different techniques.},
